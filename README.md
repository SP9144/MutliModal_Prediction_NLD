# MutliModal_Prediction_NLD

Using Multimodal Deep Learning to accurately Predict Parkinson's Disorder (PD).

## Motivation

Parkinson's disease is a brain disorder that leads to shaking, stiffness, and difficulty with walking, balance, and coordination. Parkinson's symptoms usually begin gradually and get worse over time. As the disease progresses, people may have difficulty walking and talking. 
More than 10 million people worldwide are living with PD. Incidence of Parkinson's disease increases with age, but an estimated four percent of people with PD are diagnosed before age 50. 

## Dataset

We are using the PPMI dataset [(PPMI)](https://www.michaeljfox.org/news/parkinsons-progression-markers-initiative-ppmi) available on the LONI database hosted by UCLA. As of today, the data set contains longitudinal data, including clinical, imaging and genetic data, of over 700 participants.
* Healthy Controls (C) = 213
* Parkinson's Disorder (PD) = 422
* Scans Without Evidence for Dopaminergic Deficit (SWEDD) = 81
